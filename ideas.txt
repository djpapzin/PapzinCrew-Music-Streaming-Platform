when click on "publish" it says "uploading..100%" and keeps loading while its generating images, i think we can handle this better.
- double click anywhere on the player to enlarge it. 

- how are duplicates handled? I'd like to first chck if it xists, if it does, ask user to upload different track.

- have an ai agent that generates prompts for images.

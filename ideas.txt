# PapzinCrew Music Streaming Platform — Status & Ideas

## Status (Aug 12, 2025)
- [x] MVP complete: upload → B2 → stream; metadata + cover art extraction.
- [x] B2-first storage; local only as fallback.
- [x] Streaming fixed: robust local resolution, B2 redirect/proxy; CORS verified on B2.
- [x] DB clean: broken_count=0; all tracks playable (remote 200).
- [x] Backend: detailed stream logging; mixes ordered newest-first.
- [x] Frontend: empty-state UI, enhanced upload progress stepper; auto library refresh on upload.
- [x] E2E playback test updated: accept /tracks/{id}/stream(/proxy) and use HEAD (accept 206); passing on Chromium.

## Near-term
- [ ] Mobile playback test; if using LAN origin (e.g., http://192.168.x.x:5173), add it to B2 CORS.
- [ ] Finalize production B2 CORS rules (domains, headers, maxAge).
- [x] Remove unused file: frontend/project/src/mockData.ts.
- [ ] Optional: add admin delete-by-id endpoint in backend/app/routers/tracks.py.
- [ ] Decide on using /tracks/{id}/stream/proxy for mobile (Range/CORS) vs redirect.

## Quality/ops
- [ ] Basic monitoring/logging: request IDs, structured logs, error reporting.
- [ ] File deduplication by content hash to avoid duplicate uploads.
- [ ] Rate limiting for upload/stream endpoints.
- [ ] Robust upload cancel/resume; large-file handling.
- [ ] Cover art caching/resizing; waveform preview generation.

## Product
- [ ] Playlists/queue; favorites.
- [ ] Search/filter (artist, title, BPM, tags).
- [ ] Shareable links; social previews.
- [ ] Now playing mini-player and background audio on mobile.
